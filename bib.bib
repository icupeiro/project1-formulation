The developed model is intended to be use for testing and optimization experiments in the design phase of building heating control systems. The proposed approach is tested by implementing in Matlab/Simulink the model of a building with 4 rooms. The obtained results and the advantages of the proposed method are analyzed and presented in the paper."

  Abstractnote             = {The heat balance method is a fundamental procedure that can be used for a specified control volume to describe building physics. With a better understanding of building physics and the cost-effectiveness of computers, these types of procedures are accessible to all practicing engineers. The heat balance method describes the processes using the three fundamental modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. The control volumes naturally divide the building processes into an outside balance, an inside balance, an air balance, and conduction through the building elements. This allows the building heat balance to be solved in a number of fundamental ways. This paper looks at the general formulation of the inside surface heat balance from the conduction through the building elements to the radiant exchange and convection to the air in the zone. Development of many radiant exchange models is shown; these models range from the exact solutions using uniform radiosity networks and exact view factors to mean radiant temperature (MRT) and area-weighted view factors. These radiant exchange models are directly compared to each other for a simple zone with varying aspect ratios. The radiant exchange models are then compared to determine their effect on the cooling load. Finally, other parameters that affect the inside surface heat balance are investigated to determine their sensitivity to the cooling load.},

  Abstractnote             = {The heat balance method is a fundamental procedure that can be used for a specified control volume to describe building 
physics. With a better understanding of building physics and the cost-effectiveness of computers, these types of procedures are accessible to all 
practicing engineers. The heat balance method describes the processes using the three fundamental modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and 
radiation. The control volumes naturally divide the building processes into an outside balance, an inside balance, an air balance, and conduction 
through the building elements. This allows the building heat balance to be solved in a number of fundamental ways. This paper looks at the general 
formulation of the inside surface heat balance from the conduction through the building elements to the radiant exchange and convection to the air in 
the zone. Development of many radiant exchange models is shown; these models range from the exact solutions using uniform radiosity networks and exact 
view factors to mean radiant temperature (MRT) and area-weighted view factors. These radiant exchange models are directly compared to each other for a 
simple zone with varying aspect ratios. The radiant exchange models are then compared to determine their effect on the cooling load. Finally, other 
parameters that affect the inside surface heat balance are investigated to determine their sensitivity to the cooling load.},

whole sample. Analysis of a well-known multivariate data set shows that methods currently available for selecting variables in principal component 
analysis may not lead to an appropriate subset. A new selection method, based on Procrustes Analysis, is proposed and shown to lead to a better 
subset 
for the data first analysed. Some supporting Monte Carlo results are presented, and implications for other multivariate techniques are briefly 
discussed.},

The program uses Matlab. It is available from http://mocava.s3.kth.se free of charge."

                  considered. The problem of the synthesis of a
                  feedback control, assuring that the system state is
                  ultimately bounded within a given compact set
                  containing the origin with an assigned rate of
                  convergence, is investigated. It is shown that the
                  problem has a solution if and only if there a
                  certain Lyapunov function which does not belong to a
                  preassigned class of functions (e.g., the quadratic
                  ones), but it is determined by the target set in
                  which ultimate boundedness is desired. One of the
                  advantages of this approach is that we may handle
                  systems with control constraints. No matching
                  assumptions are made. For systems with linearly
                  constrained uncertainties, it is shown that such a
                  function may be derived by numerically efficient
                  algorithms involving polyhedral sets. The resulting
                  compensator may be implemented as a linear
                  variable-structure control.}

                  feasible sets, and performs multiparametric
                  programming by a duality based approach in each

                  discrete-time linear systems is derived. The
                  condition is expressed in terms of a set of linear
                  matrix inequalities (LMIs) involving only the
                  vertices of the polytope domain. An interesting
                  result published recently is shown to be a special
                  case of ours. With an exhaustive numerical

                  constrained outputs, y(t) in Y contained in/implied
                  by R/sup p/, t in Z/sup +/. An initial state of the
                  system, x(0) in R/sup n/, is output admissible if
                  the output constraint is satisfied for all inputs
                  meeting the input constraint; the set of all such
                  states is the maximal output admissible set, O/sub
                  infinity /. It is shown that O/sub infinity / has
                  basic properties that are similar to those which
                  apply in the disturbance-free case. Procedures for
                  computing O/sub infinity / when Y is a polyhedron
                  are available. The set O/sub infinity / has
                  important applications, including the determination
                  of regions of attraction for linear closed-loop
                  systems with actuator saturation.}

                  complete results, showing that under mild
                  restrictions an optimal controller can tolerate an
                  infinite increase in gain. For gain reductions there
                  are some results for systems linear in the
                  control. In particular there is a 50\% reduction
                  tolerance if the control penalty is
                  quadratic. Usually the optimal controller cannot be
                  computed exactly. There are some results showing the
                  effects of truncation on the robustness. Essentially
                  robustness is maintained but in a reduced
                  (computable) part of the state space.},

                  applied to salvo attack of anti-ship missiles. The
                  closed form solution based on the linear formulation
                  is derived, suggesting an additional loop for
                  adjusting the impact time in addition to the
                  traditional optimal guidance loop. This solution is
                  a combination of the well-known PNG law and the
                  feedback of the impact time error, which is the
                  difference between the impact time by PNG and the
                  prescribed impact time. The new guidance law called
                  ITCG (Impact-Time-Control Guidance) can be used to
                  guide multiple missiles to hit a stationary target
                  simultaneously at a desirable impact time. Nonlinear
                  simulation of several engagement situations
                  demonstrates the performance and feasibility of
                  ITCG. In addition, the similarity of the closed form
                  solution and APNG is investigated and the switching
                  rule for practical implementation is discussed.},

                  nonlinear constrained receding horizon control is
                  given. It allows such controllers to be implemented
                  via an efficient binary tree search, avoiding
                  real-time optimization. This is of significant
                  benefit in applications that requires low real-time
                  computational complexity or low software
                  complexity. The method has a priori guarantee of
                  asymptotic stability with region of attraction being
                  a close inner approximation to the stabilizable
                  set. This is achieved by ensuring that the

  abstract     = {This thesis is divided into two separate parts. The
                  first part is about Dynamic Programming for
                  non-trivial optimal control problems. The second
                  part introduces some useful tools for analysis of
                  stability and performance of systems with
                  time-varying delays. The two papers presented in the
                  first part attacks optimal control problems with
                  finite but rapidly increasing search space. In the
                  first paper we try it reduce the complexity of the
                  optimization by exploiting the structure of a
                  certain problem. The result, if found, is an optimal
                  solution. The second paper introduces a new general
                  approach of relaxing the optimality constraint. The
                  main contribution of the paper is an extension of
                  the Bellman equality to a double inequality. This
                  inequality is a sufficient condition for a
                  suboptimal solution to be within a certain distance
                  to the optimal solution. The main approach of
                  solving the inequality in the paper is value
                  iteration, which is shown to work well in many
                  different applications. In the second part of the
                  thesis, two analysis methods for systems with
                  time-varying delays are presented in two papers. The
                  first paper presents a set of simple graphical
                  stability (and performance) criteria when the delays
                  are bounded but otherwise unknown. All that is
                  needed to verify stability is a Bode diagram of the
                  closed loop system. For more exact computations, the
                  last paper presents a toolbox for Matlab called
                  Jitterbug. It calculates quadratic costs and power
                  spectral densities of interconnected continuous-time
                  and discrete-time linear systems. The main
                  contribution of the toolbox is to make well known
                  theory easily applicable for analysis of real-time
                  systems.},

                  dual-mode, receding horizon controller which can be
                  employed for a wide class of nonlinear systems with
                  state and control constraints and model error. The
                  controller is dual-mode. In a neighborhood of the
                  origin, the control action is generated by a linear
                  feedback controller designed for the linearized
                  system. Outside this neighborhood, receding horizon
                  control is employed. Existing receding horizon
                  controllers for nonlinear, continuous time systems,
                  which are guaranteed to stabilize the nonlinear
                  system to which they are applied, require the exact
                  solution, at every instant, of an optimal control
                  problem with terminal equality constraints. These
                  requirements are considerably relaxed in the
                  dual-mode receding horizon controller presented in
                  this paper. Stability is achieved by imposing a
                  terminal inequality, rather than an equality,
                  constraint. Only approximate minimization is
                  required. A variable time horizon is
                  permitted. Robustness is achieved by employing
                  conservative state and stability constraint sets,
                  thereby permitting a margin of error. The resultant
                  dual-mode controller requires considerably less
                  online computation than existing receding horizon
                  controllers for nonlinear, constrained systems.},

                  presented proof enables us to give an explicit

                  demonstrated to exist in the original
                  paper. Combining the obtained result with the idea
                  of scaling faces of a polytope gives the method of
                  fitting the shape of level surfaces, of the Lyapunov
                  function given by the infinity norm, to the

                  stability results are derived for nonlinear
                  discrete-time systems. Some related results are
                  available in the literature, but proofs for the
                  discrete-time case are difficult to find. Our
                  motivation for obtaining these results was to
                  determine conditions under which discrete-time
                  nonlinear model predictive control is stabilizing in
                  the face of perturbations. This problem has
                  particular relevance when output (rather than state)
                  feedback is used. A nonlinear state estimator is
                  then required to reconstruct the state, and it is
                  necessary to identify the class of reconstruction
                  errors for which the cascaded estimator/controller

	They show that an optimality interval consists either of a breakpoint

	piecewise linear convex function phi ( lambda ). As a consequence,
	the optimality intervals form a partition of the closed interval
	( lambda ; mod phi ( lambda ) mod < infinity ). Based on these optimality
	intervals, they also introduce an algorithm for solving the parametric
	RHS LP problem which requires an LP solver as a subroutine. If a
	polynomial-time LP solver is used to implement this subroutine, they
	obtain a substantial improvement on the complexity of those parametric
	RHS LP instances which exhibit degeneracy. When the number of breakpoints
	of phi ( lambda ) is polynomial in terms of the size of the parametric
	problem, they show that the latter can be solved in polynomial time.},

  abstract = {The design of engine control systems has been traditionally car-ried
	out using a mix of heuristic techniques validated by simulation and
	prototyping using approximate average-value models. How-ever, the
	ever increasing demands on passengersí comfort, safety, emissions,
	and fuel consumption imposed by car manufacturers and regulations
	call for more robust techniques and the use of cycle-ac-curate models.
	We argue that these models must be hybrid because of the combination
	of time-domain and event-based behaviors. In this paper, we present
	a hybrid model of the engine in which both continuous and discrete
	time-domain as well as event-based phe-nomena are modeled in a separate
	but integrated manner. Based on this model, we formalize the specification
	of the overall engine con-trol by defining a number of hybrid control
	problems. To cope with the difficulties arising in the design of
	hybrid controllers, a design methodology is proposed. This methodology
	consists of a relaxation of the hybrid problem by simplifying some
	of its components to ob-tain a solvable problem, and then deriving
	a solution to the orig-inal control problem by appropriately modifying
	the control law so obtained to take into consideration the original
	specifications and models. The effectiveness of this approach is
	illustrated on three challenging problems: fast force-transient control,
	cutoff control, and idle speed control.},

  abstract = {This paper presents two fuzzy logic traction controllers and investigates
	their effect on longitudinal platoon systems. A fuzzy logic approach
	is appealing for traction control because of the nonlinearity and
	time-varying uncertainty involved in traction control systems. The
	fuzzy logic traction controllers we present regulate brake torque
	to control wheel slip, which is the normalized difference between
	wheel and vehicle speed. One fuzzy controller estimates the peak
	slip corresponding to the maximum tire-road adhesion coefficient
	and regulates wheel slip at the peak slip. The controller is attractive
	because of its ability to maximize acceleration and deceleration
	regardless of road condition. However, we find through simulations
	the controller`s performance degrades in the presence of time-varying
	uncertainties. The other fuzzy logic controller regulates wheel slip
	at any desired value. Through simulations we find the controller
	robust against changing road conditions and uncertainties. The target
	slip is predetermined and not necessarily the peak slip for all road
	conditions. If the target slip is set low, stable acceleration and
	deceleration is guaranteed, regardless of road condition. We also
	study the effect of traction control on longitudinal vehicle platoon
	systems using simulations. The simulations include acceleration and
	deceleration maneuvers on an icy road. The results indicate traction
	control may substantially improve longitudinal platoon performance,
	especially when icy road conditions exist.},

	value with good precision properties. A sliding-mode control has
	been designed to provide stability and reliability. Once designed,
	the control surface has been fuzzified and implemented with a programmable
	analog fuzzy circuit which uses a 0.7 mu m CMOS technology provided
	by SGS-Thomson Microelectronics. This implementation is carried out
	with a semi-automatic design flow and features high computational
	efficiency at it very low cost, especially when compared to a digital
	one. Moreover, the controller response time is less than 1 mu s.
	A flexible control of the slip coefficient has been performed. Results
	show that the desired slip coefficient is reached and kept with good
	approximation in compliance with theoretical results.},

	described by interdependent physical laws, logic rules, and operating
	constraints, denoted as Mixed Logical Dynamical (MLD) systems. These
	are described by linear dynamic equations subject to linear inequalities
	involving real and integer variables. MLD systems include constrained
	linear systems, finite state machines, some classes of discrete event
	systems, and nonlinear systems which can be approximated by piecewise
	linear functions. A predictive control scheme is proposed which is
	able to stabilize MLD systems on desired reference trajectories while
	fulfilling operating constraints, and possibly take into account
	previous qualitative knowledge in the form of heuristic rules. Due
	to the presence of integer variables, the resulting on-line optimization
	procedures are solved through Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming
	(MIQP), for which efficient solvers have been recently developed.
	Some examples and a simulation case study on a complex gas supply
	system are reported.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we formulate the problem of characterizing the stability
	of a piecewise affine (PWA) system as a verification problem. The
	basic idea is to take the whole $R^n$ as the set of initial conditions,
	and check that all the trajectories go to the origin. More precisely,
	we test for semi-global stability by restricting the set of initial
	conditions to an (arbitrarily large) bounded set $XX(0)$, and label
	as ``asymptotically stable in $T$ steps'' the trajectories that enter
	an invariant set around the origin within a finite time $T$, or as
	``unstable in $T$ steps'' the trajectories which enter a (very large)
	set $XXinst$. Subsets of $XX(0)$ leading to none of the two previous
	cases are labeled as ``not classifiable in $T$ steps''. The domain
	of asymptotical stability in $T$ steps is a subset of the domain
	of attraction of an equilibrium point, and has the practical meaning
	of collecting initial conditions from which the settling time of
	the system is smaller than $T$. In addition, it can be computed algorithmically
	in finite time. Such an algorithm requires the computation of reach
	sets, in a similar fashion to what has been proposed for verification
	of hybrid systems. In this paper we present a substantial extension
	of the verification algorithm presented in~(Bemporad and Morari,
	1999, LNCS 1569) for stability characterization of PWA systems, which
	is based on linear and mixed-integer linear programming. As a result,
	given a set of initial conditions we are able to determine its partition
	into subsets of trajectories which are either asymptotic stable,
	or unstable, or not classifiable in $T$ steps.},

	confine his attention to the class of quadratic Lyapunov functions.
	Conversely, the basic motivation of this paper is to determine whether
	there exist other functions that can be conveniently used as candidate
	Lyapunov functions. This question has a positive answer: the proposed
	class is that of polyhedral norms or, more generally, of polyhedral
	Minkowski functionals. The author shows that the class of these functions
	is universal in the sense that if the problem of ultimately bounding
	the state in an assigned convex set via state feedback control can
	be solved via a Lyapunov function and a continuous state-feedback
	compensator then it can be solved via a polyhedral Lyapunov function
	and a (possibly different) continuous control. Moreover, it is shown
	that the control can be piecewise linear. A numerical technique for
	constructing the controller is presented for the case in which the
	uncertainty constraint sets are polyhedral.},

	and input uncertainties are considered. The problem of the synthesis
	of a feedback control, assuring that the system state is ultimately
	bounded within a given compact set containing the origin with an
	assigned rate of convergence, is investigated. It is shown that the
	problem has a solution if and only if there exists a certain Lyapunov
	function which does not belong to a preassigned class of functions
	(e.g., the quadratic ones), but it is determined by the target set
	in which ultimate boundedness is desired. One of the advantages of
	this approach is that we may handle systems with control constraints.
	No matching assumptions are made. For systems with linearly constrained
	uncertainties, it is shown that such a function may be derived by
	numerically efficient algorithms involving polyhedral sets. The resulting
	compensator may be implemented as a linear variable-structure control.},

	By improving on previous decidability and undecidability results,
	we identify the precise boundary between decidability and undecidability
	of the reachability problem for hybrid automata. On the positive
	side, we give an (optimal) PSPACE reachability algorithm for the
	case of initialized rectangular automata, where all analog variables
	follow trajectories within piecewise-linear envelopes and are reinitialized
	whenever the envelope changes. Our algorithm is based on a translation
	of an initialized rectangular automaton into a timed automaton that
	defines the same timed language. The translation has practical significance
	for verification, because it guarantees the termination of symbolic
	procedures for the reachability analysis of initialized rectangular
	automata. On the negative side, we show that several slight generalizations
	of initialized rectangular automata lead to an undecidable reachability
	problem. In particular, we prove that the reachability problem is
	undecidable for timed automata with a single stopwatch.},

	expresses the PWL function in a compact and closed form. Once the

	to the stability analysis of dynamic systems. We consider uncertain
	nonlinear systems and extend the sector condition obtained by Ohta
	et al. (1993). In addition, we propose a method of selecting an optimal
	candidate. One of the main advantages of this approach is that the
	parametrization and choice of the Lyapunov candidate, as well as
	the stability analysis, result in linear programming problems.},

	of any control input nonlinearities on closed loop performance'.
	The resulting AWBT compensation is applicable to multivariable controllers

  abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current
	control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant,
	a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current
	state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields
	an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence
	is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control
	is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states.
	It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related
	industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important
	because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary
	of the set of admissible states and controls. We focus on model predictive
	control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss
	only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear
	and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research
	dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject
	has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient
	maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear
	control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles
	that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization
	of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed
	in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control
	problem solved online is exactly equivalent to the same problem with
	an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified
	infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known
	advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

  abstract = {We present a method for the construction of a robust dual-mode, receding
	horizon controller which can be employed for a wide class of nonlinear
	systems with state and control constraints and model error. The controller
	is dual-mode. In a neighborhood of the origin, the control action
	is generated by a linear feedback controller designed for the linearized
	system. Outside this neighborhood, receding horizon control is employed.
	Existing receding horizon controllers for nonlinear, continuous time
	systems, which are guaranteed to stabilize the nonlinear system to
	which they are applied, require the exact solution, at every instant,
	of an optimal control problem with terminal equality constraints.
	These requirements are considerably relaxed in the dual-mode receding
	horizon controller presented in this paper. Stability is achieved
	by imposing a terminal inequality, rather than an equality, constraint.
	Only approximate minimization is required. A variable time horizon
	is permitted. Robustness is achieved by employing conservative state
	and stability constraint sets, thereby permitting a margin of error.
	The resultant dual-mode controller requires considerably less online
	computation than existing receding horizon controllers for nonlinear,
	constrained systems.},

  abstract = {A significant number of model predictive control algorithms solve
	on-line an appropriate optimization problem and do so at every sampling
	point. The major attraction of such algorithms, like the quadratic
	dynamic matrix control, lies in the fact that they can handle hard
	constraints on the inputs (manipulated variables) and outputs of
	a process. The presence of such constraints results in an on-line
	optimization problem that produces a nonlinear controller, even when
	the plant and model dynamics are assumed linear. The paper provides
	a theoretical framework within which the stability and performance
	properties of such algorithms can be studied. Necessary and/or sufficient
	conditions for nominal and robust stability are derived and two simple
	examples are used to demonstrate their effectiveness in capturing
	the nonlinear characteristics of the system. These conditions are
	also used to analyze simulation results of a 2*2 subsystem of the
	shell standard control},

                  certain Lyapunov function which does not belong to a
                  preassigned class of functions (e.g., the quadratic
                  ones), but it is determined by the target set in
                  which ultimate boundedness is desired. One of the
                  advantages of this approach is that we may handle
                  systems with control constraints. No matching
                  assumptions are made. For systems with linearly
                  constrained uncertainties, it is shown that such a
                  function may be derived by numerically efficient
                  algorithms involving polyhedral sets. The resulting
                  compensator may be implemented as a linear
                  variable-structure control.}

                  discrete-time hybrid systems in the piecewise affine
                  (PWA) form. This problem can be formulated as the
                  reconstruction of a possibly discontinuous PWA map
                  with a multi-dimensional domain. In order to achieve
                  our goal, we provide an algorithm that exploits the
                  combined use of clustering, linear identification,
                  and pattern recognition techniques. This allows to
                  identify both the affine submodels and the
                  polyhedral partition of the domain on which each
                  submodel is valid avoiding gridding
                  procedures. Moreover, the clustering step (used for
                  classifying the datapoints) is performed in a
                  suitably defined feature space which allows also to
                  reconstruct different submodels that share the same
                  coefficients but are defined on different
                  regions. Measures of confidence on the samples are
                  introduced and exploited in order to improve the

                  the output constraint is satisfied for all inputs
                  meeting the input constraint; the set of all such
                  states is the maximal output admissible set, O/sub

                  basic properties that are similar to those which
                  apply in the disturbance-free case. Procedures for

                  . The set of all possible such initial conditions is
                  the maximal output admissible set O_{\infty} . The
                  properties of O_{\infty} and its characterization
                  are investigated. In the discrete-time case, it is
                  generally possible to represent O_{\infty} , or a
                  close approximation of it, by a finite number of
                  functional inequalities. Practical algorithms for
                  generating the functions are described. In the
                  continuous-time case simple representations of the

                  important applications in the analysis and design of
                  closed-loop systems with state and control
                  constraints. To illustrate this point, a
                  modification of the error governor control scheme
                  proposed by Kapasouris, Athans, and Stein [6] is
                  presented. It works as well as their implementation
                  but reduces the computational load on the controller
                  by several orders of magnitude.},

                  horizons, the asymptotic stability of the closed

                  say, it is possible for arbitrarily small

                  the development of computationally tractable tests
                  for determining the robust feasibility of an MPC
                  controller for linear or piecewise affine systems,
                  where the constraints are given by the union of
                  convex polyhedra and the disturbance acts additively
                  on the state. Practical tests are also presented
                  which allow one to give robust feasibility
                  guarantees for all optimal and sub-optimal MPC
                  control actions.},

                  control problem that can be solved using a single

                  multi-parametric linear program, which implies that
                  the optimal control law is piecewise affine and can
                  be explicitly pre-computed so that the linear
                  program does not have to be solved on-line. We
                  assume that the plant model is known, is
                  discrete-time and linear time-invariant, is subject
                  to unknown but bounded state disturbances and that
                  the states of the system are measured. Two numerical
                  examples are presented; one of these is taken from

                  first part is about Dynamic Programming for
                  non-trivial optimal control problems. The second
                  part introduces some useful tools for analysis of
                  stability and performance of systems with
                  time-varying delays. The two papers presented in the
                  first part attacks optimal control problems with
                  finite but rapidly increasing search space. In the
                  first paper we try it reduce the complexity of the
                  optimization by exploiting the structure of a
                  certain problem. The result, if found, is an optimal
                  solution. The second paper introduces a new general
                  approach of relaxing the optimality constraint. The
                  main contribution of the paper is an extension of
                  the Bellman equality to a double inequality. This
                  inequality is a sufficient condition for a
                  suboptimal solution to be within a certain distance
                  to the optimal solution. The main approach of
                  solving the inequality in the paper is value
                  iteration, which is shown to work well in many
                  different applications. In the second part of the
                  thesis, two analysis methods for systems with
                  time-varying delays are presented in two papers. The
                  first paper presents a set of simple graphical
                  stability (and performance) criteria when the delays
                  are bounded but otherwise unknown. All that is
                  needed to verify stability is a Bode diagram of the
                  closed loop system. For more exact computations, the
                  last paper presents a toolbox for Matlab called
                  Jitterbug. It calculates quadratic costs and power
                  spectral densities of interconnected continuous-time
                  and discrete-time linear systems. The main
                  contribution of the toolbox is to make well known
                  theory easily applicable for analysis of real-time
                  systems.},

                  level sets of the value function rather than the
                  value function set itself, is used to design robust
                  non-linear controllers for linear, discrete-time,
                  dynamical systems subject to hard constraints on
                  controls and states. The controller stabilizes the
                  system and steers all trajectories emanating in a
                  prescribed set to a control invariant set in minimum
                  time. For the robust regulator problem, the control
                  invariant terminal set is a neighborhood, preferably
                  small, of the origin; for the robust tracking
                  problem, the control invariant terminal set is a
                  neighborhood of the invariant set in which the
                  tracking error is zero. Two non-linear controllers
                  which utilize the level sets of the value function,
                  are described. The first requires the controller to
                  solve, on-line, a modest linear program whose
                  dimension is approximately the same as that of the
                  control variable. The second decomposes each level
                  set into a set of simplices; a piecewise linear
                  control law, affine in each simplex, is then
                  constructed.},

                  dual-mode, receding horizon controller which can be
                  employed for a wide class of nonlinear systems with
                  state and control constraints and model error. The
                  controller is dual-mode. In a neighborhood of the
                  origin, the control action is generated by a linear
                  feedback controller designed for the linearized
                  system. Outside this neighborhood, receding horizon
                  control is employed. Existing receding horizon
                  controllers for nonlinear, continuous time systems,
                  which are guaranteed to stabilize the nonlinear
                  system to which they are applied, require the exact
                  solution, at every instant, of an optimal control
                  problem with terminal equality constraints. These
                  requirements are considerably relaxed in the
                  dual-mode receding horizon controller presented in
                  this paper. Stability is achieved by imposing a
                  terminal inequality, rather than an equality,
                  constraint. Only approximate minimization is
                  required. A variable time horizon is
                  permitted. Robustness is achieved by employing
                  conservative state and stability constraint sets,
                  thereby permitting a margin of error. The resultant
                  dual-mode controller requires considerably less
                  online computation than existing receding horizon
                  controllers for nonlinear, constrained systems.},

                  programming (parametric RHS LP) problem phi ( lambda
                  )=min(c/sup T/x mod Ax=b+ lambda b, x>or=0). They
                  show that an optimality interval consists either of
                  a breakpoint or the open interval between two
                  consecutive breakpoints of the continuous piecewise
                  linear convex function phi ( lambda ). As a
                  consequence, the optimality intervals form a
                  partition of the closed interval ( lambda ; mod phi
                  ( lambda ) mod < infinity ). Based on these
                  optimality intervals, they also introduce an
                  algorithm for solving the parametric RHS LP problem
                  which requires an LP solver as a subroutine. If a
                  polynomial--time LP solver is used to implement this
                  subroutine, they obtain a substantial improvement on
                  the complexity of those parametric RHS LP instances
                  which exhibit degeneracy. When the number of
                  breakpoints of phi ( lambda ) is polynomial in terms
                  of the size of the parametric problem, they show
                  that the latter can be solved in polynomial time.}

  abstract     = {The design of engine control systems has been
                  traditionally car--ried out using a mix of heuristic
                  techniques validated by simulation and prototyping
                  using approximate average--value models. How--ever,
                  the ever increasing demands on passengersí comfort,
                  safety, emissions, and fuel consumption imposed by
                  car manufacturers and regulations call for more
                  robust techniques and the use of cycle--ac--curate
                  models. We argue that these models must be hybrid
                  because of the combination of time--domain and
                  event--based behaviors. In this paper, we present a
                  hybrid model of the engine in which both continuous
                  and discrete time--domain as well as event--based
                  phe--nomena are modeled in a separate but integrated
                  manner. Based on this model, we formalize the
                  specification of the overall engine con--trol by
                  defining a number of hybrid control problems. To
                  cope with the difficulties arising in the design of
                  hybrid controllers, a design methodology is
                  proposed. This methodology consists of a relaxation
                  of the hybrid problem by simplifying some of its
                  components to ob--tain a solvable problem, and then
                  deriving a solution to the orig--inal control
                  problem by appropriately modifying the control law
                  so obtained to take into consideration the original
                  specifications and models. The effectiveness of this
                  approach is illustrated on three challenging
                  problems: fast force--transient control, cutoff
                  control, and idle speed control.}

                  this paper, we propose a very robust control with a
                  static nonlinear feedback law which can consider
                  adherence and other model uncertainties, regulating
                  the wheel slip at any desired value with good
                  precision properties. A sliding--mode control has
                  been designed to provide stability and
                  reliability. Once designed, the control surface has
                  been fuzzified and implemented with a programmable
                  analog fuzzy circuit which uses a 0.7 mu m CMOS
                  technology provided by SGS--Thomson
                  Microelectronics. This implementation is carried out
                  with a semi--automatic design flow and features high
                  computational efficiency at it very low cost,
                  especially when compared to a digital one. Moreover,
                  the controller response time is less than 1 mu s. A
                  flexible control of the slip coefficient has been
                  performed. Results show that the desired slip
                  coefficient is reached and kept with good
                  approximation in compliance with theoretical
                  results. },

                  contrast with most of the previous results in the

                  attention to the class of quadratic Lyapunov
                  functions. Conversely, the basic motivation of this
                  paper is to determine whether there exist other
                  functions that can be conveniently used as candidate
                  Lyapunov functions. This question has a positive
                  answer: the proposed class is that of polyhedral
                  norms or, more generally, of polyhedral Minkowski
                  functionals. The author shows that the class of
                  these functions is universal in the sense that if
                  the problem of ultimately bounding the state in an

                  be solved via a Lyapunov function and a continuous
                  state--feedback compensator then it can be solved
                  via a polyhedral Lyapunov function and a (possibly
                  different) continuous control. Moreover, it is shown
                  that the control can be piecewise linear. A
                  numerical technique for constructing the controller
                  is presented for the case in which the uncertainty
                  constraint sets are polyhedral.}

  ABSTRACT     = {This paper presents two fuzzy logic traction
                  controllers and investigates their effect on
                  longitudinal platoon systems. A fuzzy logic approach
                  is appealing for traction control because of the
                  nonlinearity and time--varying uncertainty involved
                  in traction control systems. The fuzzy logic
                  traction controllers we present regulate brake
                  torque to control wheel slip, which is the
                  normalized difference between wheel and vehicle
                  speed. One fuzzy controller estimates the peak slip
                  corresponding to the maximum tire--road adhesion
                  coefficient and regulates wheel slip at the peak
                  slip. The controller is attractive because of its
                  ability to maximize acceleration and deceleration
                  regardless of road condition. However, we find
                  through simulations the controller`s performance
                  degrades in the presence of time--varying
                  uncertainties. The other fuzzy logic controller
                  regulates wheel slip at any desired value. Through
                  simulations we find the controller robust against
                  changing road conditions and uncertainties. The
                  target slip is predetermined and not necessarily the
                  peak slip for all road conditions. If the target
                  slip is set low, stable acceleration and
                  deceleration is guaranteed, regardless of road
                  condition. We also study the effect of traction
                  control on longitudinal vehicle platoon systems
                  using simulations. The simulations include
                  acceleration and deceleration maneuvers on an icy
                  road. The results indicate traction control may
                  substantially improve longitudinal platoon
                  performance, especially when icy road conditions
                  exist.}

                  characterizing the stability of a piecewise affine
                  (PWA) system as a verification problem. The basic
                  idea is to take the whole $R^n$ as the set of
                  initial conditions, and check that all the
                  trajectories go to the origin. More precisely, we
                  test for semi--global stability by restricting the
                  set of initial conditions to an (arbitrarily large)
                  bounded set $XX(0)$, and label as ``asymptotically
                  stable in $T$ steps'' the trajectories that enter an
                  invariant set around the origin within a finite time
                  $T$, or as ``unstable in $T$ steps'' the
                  trajectories which enter a (very large) set
                  $XXinst$. Subsets of $XX(0)$ leading to none of the
                  two previous cases are labeled as ``not classifiable
                  in $T$ steps''. The domain of asymptotical stability
                  in $T$ steps is a subset of the domain of attraction
                  of an equilibrium point, and has the practical
                  meaning of collecting initial conditions from which
                  the settling time of the system is smaller than
                  $T$. In addition, it can be computed algorithmically
                  in finite time. Such an algorithm requires the
                  computation of reach sets, in a similar fashion to
                  what has been proposed for verification of hybrid
                  systems. In this paper we present a substantial
                  extension of the verification algorithm presented
                  in~(Bemporad and Morari, 1999, LNCS 1569) for
                  stability characterization of PWA systems, which is
                  based on linear and mixed--integer linear
                  programming. As a result, given a set of initial
                  conditions we are able to determine its partition

                  asymptotic stable, or unstable, or not classifiable

                  analysis algorithm presented
                  in \cite{BeMo99--2,BTM00} can be successfully used
                  to solve the batch evaporator benchmark verification
                  problem \cite{Kow98}. MLD models describe hybrid
                  systems where discrete--time linear dynamic
                  equations, logic rules, and automata interact. The
                  reachability analysis algorithm is based on linear
                  and mixed--integer linear programming. After
                  reviewing MLD models and the algorithm, we detail
                  the modeling of the batch evaporator benchmark
                  process and its verification in order to illustrate
                  the versatility of the analysis tool.},

                  techniques for dealing with saturating actuators are
                  equivalent. Model predictive control, on the one
                  hand, is based on a receding horizon quadratic
                  optimal control problem which is solved subject to
                  input constraints. On the other hand, anti--windup
                  methods are ad--hoc procedures which achieve input
                  saturation in an instantaneous fashion. Both methods
                  are known to perform well in practice and each has
                  its strong advocates. In this paper we characterise
                  regions of the state--space wherein both techniques

                  Lagrange multipliers of a large class of nonlinear
                  programming problems with respect to a general
                  parametric variation in the problem functions. The
                  local solution is assumed to satisfy the second
                  order sufficient conditions for a strict
                  minimum. Although theoretically valid for higher
                  order derivatives, the analysis concentrates on the
                  estimation of the first order (first partial
                  derivative) sensitivity information, which can be
                  explicitly expressed in terms of the problem

                  given in terms of the mixed logarithmic--barrier

                  clearly applicable to any algorithm that generates a

                  the objective function of the on--line optimization,

                  ideas of this work, however, are expandable to other
                  DMC--type controllers. The keys to the stability
                  conditions are: to use an end--condition in the
                  moving horizon on--line optimization; to have
                  coefficients of the move suppression term in the
                  objective function of the on--line optimization
                  satisfy certain inequalities; and to express the
                  uncertainty as deviations in the unit pulse response
                  coefficients of the nominal plant. These deviations
                  and disturbances must also satisfy certain
                  inequalities. An off--line tuning procedure for
                  robust stability and performance of a class of DMC
                  controllers is also included, which determines an
                  optimal moving horizon length and optimal values for
                  coefficients of the move suppression term. The
                  applicability of our approach is elucidated through
                  numerical simulations.}

                  water tank process with both input and state

                  method suits both single-- and multiple--input
                  systems with or without time delays. It seems quite
                  robust and especially suitable for large reference
                  value changes and disturbances. It is feasible for
                  processes with sampling periods of 10 seconds or
                  more, i.e. for many industrial applications
                  involving flow, heat, chemical processes, and

                  programs. Many verification tasks for such programs
                  can be expressed as reachability problems for hybrid
                  automata. By improving on previous decidability and
                  undecidability results, we identify the precise
                  boundary between decidability and undecidability of
                  the reachability problem for hybrid automata. On the
                  positive side, we give an (optimal) PSPACE
                  reachability algorithm for the case of initialized
                  rectangular automata, where all analog variables
                  follow trajectories within piecewise--linear
                  envelopes and are reinitialized whenever the
                  envelope changes. Our algorithm is based on a
                  translation of an initialized rectangular automaton
                  into a timed automaton that defines the same timed
                  language. The translation has practical significance
                  for verification, because it guarantees the
                  termination of symbolic procedures for the
                  reachability analysis of initialized rectangular
                  automata. On the negative side, we show that several
                  slight generalizations of initialized rectangular
                  automata lead to an undecidable reachability
                  problem. In particular, we prove that the
                  reachability problem is undecidable for timed
                  automata with a single stopwatch.},

                  function in a compact and closed form. Once the

                  essential in the design of controllers for
                  constrained systems, since state and control

                  initial state belongs to a positively invariant set
                  for the closed--loop system. The paper briefly
                  reviews some concepts in invariant set theory and
                  shows that the various sets can be computed using a
                  single recursive algo--rithm. The ideas presented in
                  the first part of the paper are applied to the
                  fundamental design goal of guaranteeing feasibility
                  in pre--dictive control. New necessary and
                  sufficient conditions based on the control horizon,
                  prediction horizon and terminal constraint set are
                  given in order to guarantee that the predictive
                  control problem will be feasible for all time, given

                  dual--mode, receding horizon controller which can be
                  employed for a wide class of nonlinear systems with
                  state and control constraints and model error. The
                  controller is dual--mode. In a neighborhood of the
                  origin, the control action is generated by a linear
                  feedback controller designed for the linearized
                  system. Outside this neighborhood, receding horizon
                  control is employed. Existing receding horizon
                  controllers for nonlinear, continuous time systems,
                  which are guaranteed to stabilize the nonlinear
                  system to which they are applied, require the exact
                  solution, at every instant, of an optimal control
                  problem with terminal equality constraints. These
                  requirements are considerably relaxed in the
                  dual--mode receding horizon controller presented in
                  this paper. Stability is achieved by imposing a
                  terminal inequality, rather than an equality,
                  constraint. Only approximate minimization is
                  required. A variable time horizon is
                  permitted. Robustness is achieved by employing
                  conservative state and stability constraint sets,
                  thereby permitting a margin of error. The resultant
                  dual--mode controller requires considerably less
                  online computation than existing receding horizon
                  controllers for nonlinear, constrained systems.}

                  considered. The problem is reduced to the
                  construction of a polytope satisfying some
                  conditions. A generalization of the concept of
                  sector condition that it makes possible to evaluate
                  a given nonlinear function by using a set of
                  piecewise--linear functions is proposed. This
                  improvement greatly reduces the conservatism in the
                  stability analysis of nonlinear systems. Two
                  algorithms for constructing such polytopes are
                  proposed, and two examples are shown to demonstrate
                  the usefulness of the results. },

                  variables. Logical inference (prove that ... given
                  that ...) can then be formulated as integer or
                  mixed--integer program.\\ A given proposition is
                  found to be valid. This proposition relates several
                  logical variables to each other. The point of this
                  and many other works is that the relations existing
                  between logical variables can be translated into
                  linear inequalities between the truth value of the
                  logical variables. If the proposition is first
                  translated into conjunctive normal form (A and B and
                  C and ... Z), no additional variables must be
                  introduced. Each term gives rise to an inequality,
                  that has to be fulfilled simultaneously to all the
                  others. \\ For instance, stating that
                  \begin{equation} (P_1 \wedge P_2) \vee P_3
                  \Rightarrow P_4 \wedge P_5 \end{equation} can be
                  modeled as a set of inequalities, as described in
                  the paper, i.e. first finding the conjunctive normal
                  form of the proposition. This gives a set of
                  constraints having to be fulfilled in the
                  problem. \\ The interest of this transformation lies
                  in the solution of logical inference questions,
                  i.e. to prove a statement given a list of logical
                  facts. Logical inference with uncertain knowledge
                  can be modelled as a relaxation of the
                  inequalities. }

  ABSTRACT     = {A discrete--time control algorithm for robust
                  vehicle traction, which includes antiskid braking
                  and antispin acceleration, is presented. The
                  algorithm is a nonlinear feedback scheme that can be
                  designed via classical digital control theory. The
                  algorithm is easy to tune and modify to incorporate
                  higher--order dynamics, which may be necessary for a
                  practical hardware setup. The robust controller
                  provides stable and reliable performance under a
                  variety of uncertainties involved in the
                  vehicle/brake system that are difficult to
                  measure. The effectiveness of this new scheme is
                  demonstrated by experiments on antiskid braking.}

                  singly exponential in the worst case. Moreover it

                  objective functions without convexity hypothesis
                  under linear constraints, and to objective functions
                  with arbitrary parametric coefficients. For problems
                  with additive parameters the method is worst--case
                  optimal. Examples computed in a

                  the method over Fourier--Motzkin and its

                  provides graceful degradation of performance. The
                  attractive features of this scheme are its

  abstract     = {A significant number of model predictive control
                  algorithms solve on--line an appropriate
                  optimization problem and do so at every sampling
                  point. The major attraction of such algorithms, like
                  the quadratic dynamic matrix control, lies in the
                  fact that they can handle hard constraints on the
                  inputs (manipulated variables) and outputs of a
                  process. The presence of such constraints results in
                  an on--line optimization problem that produces a
                  nonlinear controller, even when the plant and model
                  dynamics are assumed linear. The paper provides a
                  theoretical framework within which the stability and
                  performance properties of such algorithms can be
                  studied. Necessary and/or sufficient conditions for
                  nominal and robust stability are derived and two
                  simple examples are used to demonstrate their
                  effectiveness in capturing the nonlinear
                  characteristics of the system. These conditions are
                  also used to analyze simulation results of a 2*2
                  subsystem of the shell standard control}

                  infinite time optimal solution is a piecewise affine
                  state feedback control law. In this paper we present
                  an algorithm to compute the optimal solution for the
                  finite time case where the algorithm combines a
                  dynamic programming exploration strategy with
                  multi-parametric linear programming and basic
                  polyhedral manipulation. We extend the ideas to the
                  infinite time case and show the equivalence of the
                  dynamic programming generated solution with the
                  solution to the infinite time optimal control

  abstract = {The design of engine control systems has been traditionally
             car-ried out using a mix of heuristic techniques validated by
             simulation and prototyping using approximate average-value
             models. How-ever, the ever increasing demands on passengersí
             comfort, safety, emissions, and fuel consumption imposed by car
             manufacturers and regulations call for more robust techniques and
             the use of cycle-ac-curate models. We argue that these models
             must be hybrid because of the combination of time-domain and
             event-based behaviors. In this paper, we present a hybrid model
             of the engine in which both continuous and discrete time-domain
             as well as event-based phe-nomena are modeled in a separate but
             integrated manner. Based on this model, we formalize the
             specification of the overall engine con-trol by defining a number
             of hybrid control problems. To cope with the difficulties arising
             in the design of hybrid controllers, a design methodology is
             proposed. This methodology consists of a relaxation of the hybrid
             problem by simplifying some of its components to ob-tain a
             solvable problem, and then deriving a solution to the orig-inal
             control problem by appropriately modifying the control law so
             obtained to take into consideration the original specifications
             and models. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated on
             three challenging problems: fast force-transient control, cutoff
             control, and idle speed control.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we formulate the problem of characterizing the
             stability of a piecewise affine (PWA) system as a verification
             problem. The basic idea is to take the whole $R^n$ as the set of
             initial conditions, and check that all the trajectories go to the
             origin. More precisely, we test for semi-global stability by
             restricting the set of initial conditions to an (arbitrarily
             large) bounded set $XX(0)$, and label as ``asymptotically stable
             in $T$ steps'' the trajectories that enter an invariant set
             around the origin within a finite time $T$, or as ``unstable in
             $T$ steps'' the trajectories which enter a (very large) set
             $XXinst$. Subsets of $XX(0)$ leading to none of the two previous
             cases are labeled as ``not classifiable in $T$ steps''. The
             domain of asymptotical stability in $T$ steps is a subset of the
             domain of attraction of an equilibrium point, and has the
             practical meaning of collecting initial conditions from which the
             settling time of the system is smaller than $T$. In addition, it
             can be computed algorithmically in finite time. Such an algorithm
             requires the computation of reach sets, in a similar fashion to
             what has been proposed for verification of hybrid systems. In
             this paper we present a substantial extension of the verification
             algorithm presented in~(Bemporad and Morari, 1999, LNCS 1569) for
             stability characterization of PWA systems, which is based on
             linear and mixed-integer linear programming. As a result, given a
             set of initial conditions we are able to determine its partition
             into subsets of trajectories which are either asymptotic stable,
             or unstable, or not classifiable in $T$ steps.}

             and sufficient conditions based on the control horizon,

             continuous-time system with structured time-varying parameter
             uncertainties and input disturbances with a Lyapunov-function
             approach. In contrast with most of the previous results in the
             literature, the author does not confine his attention to the
             class of quadratic Lyapunov functions. Conversely, the basic
             motivation of this paper is to determine whether there exist
             other functions that can be conveniently used as candidate
             Lyapunov functions. This question has a positive answer: the
             proposed class is that of polyhedral norms or, more generally, of
             polyhedral Minkowski functionals. The author shows that the class
             of these functions is universal in the sense that if the problem
             of ultimately bounding the state in an assigned convex set via
             state feedback control can be solved via a Lyapunov function and
             a continuous state-feedback compensator then it can be solved via
             a polyhedral Lyapunov function and a (possibly different)
             continuous control. Moreover, it is shown that the control can be
             piecewise linear. A numerical technique for constructing the
             controller is presented for the case in which the uncertainty
             constraint sets are polyhedral.}

             state is ultimately bounded within a given compact set containing
             the origin with an assigned rate of convergence, is investigated.
             It is shown that the problem has a solution if and only if there
             exists a certain Lyapunov function which does not belong to a
             preassigned class of functions (e.g., the quadratic ones), but it
             is determined by the target set in which ultimate boundedness is
             desired. One of the advantages of this approach is that we may
             handle systems with control constraints. No matching assumptions
             are made. For systems with linearly constrained uncertainties, it
             is shown that such a function may be derived by numerically
             efficient algorithms involving polyhedral sets. The resulting

             the origin, the control action is generated by a linear feedback
             controller designed for the linearized system. Outside this
             neighborhood, receding horizon control is employed. Existing
             receding horizon controllers for nonlinear, continuous time
             systems, which are guaranteed to stabilize the nonlinear system
             to which they are applied, require the exact solution, at every
             instant, of an optimal control problem with terminal equality
             constraints. These requirements are considerably relaxed in the
             dual-mode receding horizon controller presented in this paper.
             Stability is achieved by imposing a terminal inequality, rather
             than an equality, constraint. Only approximate minimization is
             required. A variable time horizon is permitted. Robustness is
             achieved by employing conservative state and stability constraint
             sets, thereby permitting a margin of error. The resultant
             dual-mode controller requires considerably less online
             computation than existing receding horizon controllers for
             nonlinear, constrained systems.}

  abstract = {A significant number of model predictive control algorithms
             solve on-line an appropriate optimization problem and do so at
             every sampling point. The major attraction of such algorithms,
             like the quadratic dynamic matrix control, lies in the fact that
             they can handle hard constraints on the inputs (manipulated
             variables) and outputs of a process. The presence of such
             constraints results in an on-line optimization problem that
             produces a nonlinear controller, even when the plant and model
             dynamics are assumed linear. The paper provides a theoretical
             framework within which the stability and performance properties
             of such algorithms can be studied. Necessary and/or sufficient
             conditions for nominal and robust stability are derived and two
             simple examples are used to demonstrate their effectiveness in
             capturing the nonlinear characteristics of the system. These
             conditions are also used to analyze simulation results of a 2*2
             subsystem of the shell standard control}

which expresses the PWL function in a compact and closed form. Once the
parametrization problem is properly stated, we focus on its application
to the stability analysis of dynamic systems. We consider uncertain
nonlinear systems and extend the sector condition obtained by Ohta et al.
(1993). In addition, we propose a method of selecting an optimal
candidate. One of the main advantages of this approach is that the
parametrization and choice of the Lyapunov candidate, as well as the
stability analysis, result in linear programming problems.},

    pages={277--303},
    ABSTRACT={This paper presents two fuzzy logic traction controllers and investigates their
   effect on longitudinal platoon systems. A fuzzy logic approach is appealing for
   traction control because of the nonlinearity and time-varying uncertainty involved
   in traction control systems. The fuzzy logic traction controllers we present regulate
   brake torque to control wheel slip, which is the normalized difference between
   wheel and vehicle speed. One fuzzy controller estimates the peak slip
   corresponding to the maximum tire-road adhesion coefficient and regulates wheel
   slip at the peak slip. The controller is attractive because of its ability to maximize
   acceleration and deceleration regardless of road condition. However, we find
   through simulations the controller`s performance degrades in the presence of
   time-varying uncertainties. The other fuzzy logic controller regulates wheel slip at
   any desired value. Through simulations we find the controller robust against
   changing road conditions and uncertainties. The target slip is predetermined and
   not necessarily the peak slip for all road conditions. If the target slip is set low,
   stable acceleration and deceleration is guaranteed, regardless of road condition.
   We also study the effect of traction control on longitudinal vehicle platoon systems
   using simulations. The simulations include acceleration and deceleration maneuvers
   on an icy road. The results indicate traction control may substantially improve
   longitudinal platoon performance, especially when icy road conditions exist.}

  abstract ={
       Hybrid automata model systems with both digital and analog components,
       such as embedded control programs. Many verification tasks for such programs
       can be expressed as reachability problems for hybrid automata. By improving
       on previous decidability and undecidability results, we identify the precise
       boundary between decidability and undecidability of the reachability problem
       for hybrid automata. On the positive side, we give an (optimal) PSPACE
       reachability algorithm for the case of initialized rectangular automata,
       where all analog variables follow trajectories within piecewise-linear
       envelopes and are reinitialized whenever the envelope changes. Our algorithm
       is based on a translation of an initialized rectangular automaton into a
       timed automaton that defines the same timed language. The translation has
       practical significance for verification, because it guarantees the
       termination of symbolic procedures for the reachability analysis of
       initialized rectangular automata. On the negative side, we show that several
       slight generalizations of initialized rectangular automata lead to an
       undecidable reachability problem. In particular, we prove that the
       reachability problem is undecidable for timed automata with a single
       stopwatch.},

inequalities in the involved logical variables. Logical inference (prove that ... given that ...) can then be formulated as integer or mixed-integer 
program.\\
A given proposition is found to be valid. This proposition relates several logical variables to each other. The point of this and many other works is 
that the relations existing between logical variables can be translated into linear inequalities between the truth value of the logical variables. If 
the proposition is first translated into conjunctive normal form (A and B and C and ... Z), no additional variables must be introduced. Each term 
gives rise to an inequality, that has to be fulfilled simultaneously to all the others. \\
For instance, stating that
\begin{equation}
(P_1 \wedge P_2) \vee P_3 \Rightarrow P_4 \wedge P_5
\end{equation}
can be modeled as a set of inequalities, as described in the paper, i.e. first finding the conjunctive normal form of the proposition. This gives a 
set of constraints having to be fulfilled in the problem. \\
The interest of this transformation lies in the solution of logical inference questions, i.e. to prove a statement given a list of logical facts. 
Logical inference with uncertain knowledge can be modelled as a relaxation of the inequalities.

                  in control is the derivation of systematic tools for
                  the computation of controllers for constrained
                  nonlinear systems that can guarantee closed-loop
                  stability, feasibility, and optimality with respect
                  to some performance index. This book focuses on the
                  efficient and systematic computation of closed-form
                  optimal controllers for the powerful class of
                  fast-sampled constrained piecewise affine
                  systems. These systems may exhibit rather complex
                  behavior and are equivalent to many other hybrid
                  system formalisms (combining continuous-valued
                  dynamics with logic rules) reported in the
                  literature. Furthermore, piecewise affine systems
                  are a useful modeling tool that can capture general
                  nonlinearities (e.g. by local approximation),
                  constraints, saturations, switches, and other hybrid
                  modeling phenomena. The first part of the book
                  presents an introduction to the mathematical and
                  control theoretical background material needed for
                  the full understanding of the book. The second part
                  provides an in depth look at the computational and
                  control theoretic properties of the controllers and
                  part three presents different analysis and

system using the input-to-state stability (ISS) framework. First, we show that only input-to-state practical stability can be ensured in general for 
closed-loop min-max MPC systems; and we provide explicit bounds on the evolution of the closed-loop system state. Then, we derive new conditions for 
guaranteeing ISS of min-max MPC closed-loop systems, using a dual-mode approach. An example illustrates the presented theory.},

abstract={This paper illustrates the application of hybrid modeling and model predictive control techniques to the management of air-to-fuel ratio 
and 
torque in advanced technology gasoline direct-injection stratified-charge (DISC) engines. A DISC engine is an example of a constrained hybrid 
dynamical system, because it can operate in two distinct modes (stratified and homogeneous) and because the mode-dependent constraints on the 
air-to-fuel ratio and on the spark timing need to be enforced during its operation to avoid misfire, knock, and high combustion variability. In this 
paper, we approximate the DISC engine dynamics as a two-mode discrete-time switched affine system. Using this approximation, we tune a hybrid model 
predictive controller with integral action based on online mixed-integer quadratic optimization, and show the effectiveness of the approach through 
simulations. Then, using an offline multiparametric optimization procedure, we convert the controller into an equivalent explicit piecewise affine 
form that is easily implementable in an automotive microcontroller through a lookup table of linear gains},

abstract = {Mechatronic systems in the automotive applications are characterized by significant nonlinearities and tight performance specifications 
further exacerbated by state and input constraints. Model Predictive Control (MPC) in conjunction with hybrid modeling can be an attractive and 
systematic methodology to handle these challenging control problems. In this paper, we focus on a mass spring damper system actuated by an 
electromagnet, which is one of the most common elements in the automotive actuators, with fuel injectors representing a concrete example. We present 
two designs which are based, respectively, on a linear MPC approach in cascade with a nonlinear state-dependent saturation, and on a hybrid MPC 
approach. The performance and the complexity of the two MPC controllers are compared.}

Such as intelligent climate control systems in commercial greenhouses, where the solar irradiance affects the use of supplemental lighting. This paper proposes a novel method to predict the forthcoming weather using an artificial neural network. The neural network used is a NARX network, which is known to model non-linear systems well. The predictions are compared to both a design reference year as well as commercial weather forecasts based upon numerical modelling. The results presented in this paper show that the network outperforms the commercial forecast for lower step aheads (< 5). For larger step aheads the network's performance is in the range of the commercial forecast. However, the neural network approach is fast, fairly precise and allows for further expansion with higher resolution.",

    abstract = "Traditionally, in building energy modeling (BEM) programs, occupant behavior (OB) inputs are deterministic and less indicative of real world scenarios, contributing to discrepancies between simulated and actual energy use in buildings. This paper presents a new OB modeling tool, with an occupant behavior functional mock-up unit (obFMU) that enables co-simulation with BEM programs implementing functional mock-up interface (FMI). The components detailed in the development of the obFMU include an overview of the DNAS (drivers-needs-actions-systems) ontology and the occupant behavior eXtensible Markup Language (obXML) schema, in addition to details on the creation of the obFMU that contains the co-simulation interface, the data model and solvers. To demonstrate functionality of the tool, three examples of occupant behaviors were simulated, including: (1) turning on and off lights, (2) opening and closing windows, and (3) turning on and off the air conditioners. The obFMU can be used via co-simulation with all building simulation programs that implement the FMI, thus users are not limited to a particular tool. Another advantage is the use of obXML schema to represent occupant behavior, standardize the description of occupant behavior enabling information exchange."

The performance of model predictive control relies, among other things, on the quality of weather forecasts and building occupancy predictions. The present study compares the accuracy and computational demand of two occupancy estimation and prediction approaches suitable for building model predictive control: (1) count prediction based on indoor climate modeling and parameter estimation ``using common sensors'', (2) count prediction based on data from 3D stereovision camera. The performance of the two approaches was tested in two rooms of a case study building. The results show that the method with dedicated sensors outperforms common sensors. However, if a building is not equipped with dedicated sensors, the present study shows that the common sensor method can be a satisfactory alternative to be used in model predictive control.",

It was found that the blackbox models outperform the gray- and white-box models in most cases, but the accuracy highly depends on the training data in terms of both period and modes of heat transfer covered by the data set. The average mean absolute error for the best performing black-box model was 0.4 degC as compared to 1.0 degC and 0.7 degC for the gray-box and whitebox models, respectively. In terms of accuracy, the graybox models are a reasonable alternative for black-box only in case of short-term predictions, in which their error decreases to around 0.3-0.8 degC , depending on the room.",

abstract = "Climate changes, diminishing world supplies of non-renewable fuels, as well as economic aspects are probably the most significant driving factors of the current effort to save energy. As buildings account for about 40% of global final energy use, efficient building climate control can significantly contribute to the saving effort. Predictive building automation can be used to operate buildings in an energy and cost effective manner with minimum retrofitting requirements. In such a predictive control approach, dynamic building models are of crucial importance for a good control performance. An algorithm which has not been used in building modeling yet, namely a combination of minimization of multi-step ahead prediction errors and partial least squares will be investigated. Subsequently, two case studies are presented: the first is an artificial model of a building constructed in Trnsys environment, while the second is a real-life case study. The proposed identification algorithm is then validated and tested."

It provides a quick prediction with a far less computation than the whole building simulation tools (e.g. EnergyPlus). The GP model developed in this study is capable of predicting the behavior of a building system (fan energy consumption). This paper reports how the authors developed the GP model. In particular, this paper addresses how to deal with outliers existing in BEMS data set. In this study, RANdom Sample Consensus (RANSAC) was selected for detecting the outliers from the data set. The RANSAC method can be beneficially applied to improve the accuracy of the GP model."

The tool enables estimation of model parameters using user-defined sequences of methods, which are particularlyhelpful in non-convex problems. A user can start estimation with a chosen global search method and subsequently refine the estimates with a local search method. Several methods are available already and the tool’s architectureallows for easily adding new ones. The advantages of having a single interface to multiple methods and using them in sequences are highlighted on a case study in which the parameters of a Modelica-based gray-box model of a building zone (nonlinear, multi-output) are estimated using 9 different combinations of methods.

	abstract = "Model predictive control (MPC) for buildings is attracting significant attention in research and industry due to its potential to address a number of challenges facing the building industry, including energy cost reduction, grid integration, and occupant connectivity. However, the strategy has not yet been implemented at any scale, largely due to the significant effort required to configure and calibrate the model used in the MPC controller. While many studies have focused on methods to expedite model configuration and improve model accuracy, few have studied the impact a wide range of factors have on the accuracy of the resulting model. In addition, few have continued on to analyze these factors’ impact on MPC controller performance in terms of final operating costs. Therefore, this study first identifies the practical factors affecting model setup, specifically focusing on the thermal envelope. The seven that are identified are building design, model structure, model order, data set, data quality, identification algorithm and initial guesses, and software tool-chain. Then, through a large number of trials, it analyzes each factor’s influence on model accuracy, focusing on grey-box models for a single zone building envelope. Finally, this study implements a subset of the models identified with these factor variations in heating, ventilating, and air conditioning MPC controllers, and tests them in simulation of a representative case that aims to optimally cool a single-zone building with time-varying electricity prices. It is found that a difference of up to 20% in cooling cost for the cases studied can occur between the best performing model and the worst performing model. The primary factors attributing to this were model structure and initial parameter guesses during parameter estimation of the model."

    abstract = "A major challenge facing the buildings sector is the absence of continuous commissioning and the lack of performance monitoring and evaluation leading to buildings energy performance gaps between predicted and actual measured performance. Aiming to better characterize, evaluate and bridge these gaps, the paper proposes an online building energy performance monitoring and evaluation tool ObepME, serving as a basis for fault detection and diagnostics and forming a backbone for continuous commissioning. A calibrated building dynamic energy model is developed and employed to automatically run on a daily basis and simulate the building transient performance for the previous day. The simulated energy consumption results form a baseline to which the actual collected data are compared to evaluate the dynamic energy performance gap. The OU44 University building in Denmark is considered as a case study to implement the proposed framework. A holistic energy model was developed in EnergyPlus and calibrated employing data from various building meters, collected weather conditions, generated occupancy schedules and systems operational parameters and set-points. The calibrated model was employed in the ObepME tool to automatically and continuously monitor and evaluate the OU44 building energy performance, on the level of the whole building and individual energy systems consumption, throughout the period from February to mid-March 2017. The reported dynamic energy performance gap was around −2.85{\%}, −3.47{\%} and 5.48{\%} for heating, total electricity and ventilation system electricity consumption. In addition, specific observations were made on a daily basis in terms of the overall electricity, heating, lighting and ventilation energy consumption as highlighted by the ObepME tool. The ObepME tool is currently running automatically as a part of the OU44 building continuous commissioning and performance evaluation aiming to identify possible discrepancies and deviations paving the way for a methodical preventive fault detection and diagnostics process on various levels in the building.",

The method of using building information modelling for the building energy modelling process, named building information modelling-based building energy modelling has become a prevalent and attractive topic in both the research and the industry society in recent years. This paper presents an overall review on the building design process, and applications of building information modelling and building energy modelling in the design process. It also provides an in-depth review on the development of building information modelling-based building energy modelling methods and the development of prevalent informational infrastructures. Meanwhile, this literature review provides a special consideration on the maturity of building data transformation between building information modelling and building energy modelling for building energy simulation process, from the step 1 identifying the geometry, thermal properties of buildings to the step 6 the information and components for HVAC systems. In general, the current building information modelling-based building energy modelling methods are thoroughly evaluated and the trends for future developments are outlined. It is realised that the Building Information Modelling based Building Energy Modelling is particular appropriate for the early design stage, where the most suitable and cost effective approaches for energy efficient design can be integrated into the overall building design process."

Alternatively, on-line parameter estimation proposes updating a model every time a new data point is available: this establishes a direct link between external events, such as the weather, and the identifiability of parameters. The present study uses the Sequential Monte Carlo method to train a lumped building energy model (RC model), and thus estimate a Heat Loss Coefficient, and other parameters, sequentially. Results show the direct impact of solicitations (solar irradiance and indoor heat input) on this estimation, in real time. The method is validated by comparing its results with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for off-line parameter estimation."

The proposed method is an improvement over the existing nonlinear filter-based methods such as the joint EKF or Unscented Kalman Filter, which is widely adopted in previous building controls research. Case studies using both simulation and real measurements are conducted to demonstrate the proposed algorithm when used for a building thermal zone. Data from parametric simulations are used to test the thermal model's ability to capture parameter variations. Measured data from five identical offices is collected to test the performance of parameter estimates and state predictions under real-life operation. Overall, the proposed algorithm is 25% faster than a conventional EKF with improved numerical stability. It can also help mitigate numerical instabilities seen in previous EKF research. The reduced thermal model used in this paper is also capable of detecting most of the parametric changes to the thermal zone and providing reliable temperature predictions."

    abstract = "Occupancy in buildings is one of the key factors influencing air-conditioning energy use. Occupant presence and absence are stochastic. However, static operation schedules are widely used by facility departments for air-conditioning systems in commercial buildings. As a result, such systems cannot adapt to actual energy demand for offices that are not fully occupied during their operating time. This study analyzes a seven-month period of occupancy data based on motion signals collected from six offices with ten occupants in a commercial building, covering both private and multi-person offices. Based on an occupancy analysis, a learning-based demand-driven control strategy is proposed for sensible cooling. It predicts occupants' next presence and the presence duration of the remainder of a day by learning their behavior in the past and current days, and then the predicted occupancy information is employed indirectly to infer setback temperature setpoints according to rules we specified in this study. The strategy is applied for the controls of a cooling system using passive chilled beams for sensible cooling of office spaces. Over the period of two months both a baseline control and the proposed demand-driven control were operated on forty-two weekdays of real-world occupancy. Using the demand-driven control, an energy saving of 20.3% was achieved as compared to the benchmark. We found that energy savings potential in an individual office was inversely correlated to its occupancy rate."

Improving the energy efficiency of such systems is a critical objective for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning towards renewable sources of energy supply. The interest of this paper is to explore means to increase the efficiency of HVAC systems in accommodating occupants’ behavior in real time. For instance, rooms in office buildings are not always occupied by occupants during scheduled HVAC service periods. This offers an opportunity to reduce unnecessary energy demands of HVAC systems associated with occupants’ behavior. An in-depth analysis of occupants’ stochastic behavior within an office building is conducted in this paper. A demand-driven control strategy is proposed that automatically responds to occupants’ energy-related behavior for reducing energy consumption and maintains room temperature for occupants with similar performances as a static cooling. In this control strategy, two types of machine learning methods – unsupervised and supervised learning – are applied to learn occupants’ behavior in two learning processes. The occupancy-related information learned by the algorithms is used by a set of specified rules to infer real-time room setpoints for controlling the office's space cooling system. This learning-based approach intends to reduce the need for human intervention in the cooling system’s control. The proposed strategy was applied to control the cooling system of the office building under real-world conditions. Eleven case study office spaces were selected, representing three typical office uses: single person offices, multi-person offices, and meeting rooms. The experimental results report between 7% and 52% energy savings as compared to the conventionally-scheduled cooling systems."

The application of data analytics-based methods makes it possible to exploit the potentialities of occupancy related knowledge to enhance the energy management in buildings. A methodology, aimed at implementing an occupancy-based HVAC system operation schedule, is presented in this article. The process is based on the convenience of displacing groups of occupants with similar occupancy patterns to the same thermal zone. An optimisation of the stop schedule of an HVAC system has been investigated, considering a typical week’s occupancy patterns. The methodology was used to analyse the Zaanstad Town Hall (The Netherlands), considering anonymous occupancy data for a monitoring period of four months. The resulting optimised schedule was tested, through an energy simulation approach, considering a model calibrated with real energy consumption data. The savings related to the energy consumption of the HVAC system, as a result of the implementation of the strategy, in comparison to an occupancy-independent operation schedule amounted to 14%. The proposed process can be generalized and drive energy managers in evaluating optimised occupancy-based HVAC system operation schedules."

So, an intelligent controller applied to the buildings for energy and comfort management could achieve significant reduction in energy consumption while improving occupant&rsquo;s comfort. Conventional on/off controllers were only able to automate the tasks in building and were not well suited for energy optimization tasks. Therefore, building energy management has become a focal point in recent years, promising the development of various technologies for various scenarios. This paper deals with a state of the art review on recent developments in building energy management system (BEMS) and occupants comfort, focusing on three model types: white box, black box, and gray box models. Through a comparative study, this paper presents pros and cons of each model.},

The MPC consists of a whole building optimization for energy that is supplemented with a zone operative temperature (ZOT) comfort metric. A ZOT based metric was used to evaluate thermal comfort, as traditional air temperature metrics neglect radiative impacts on comfort. The comfort metric is employed after the energy optimization to ensure comfort is the highest priority and maintained in each zone. A final layer of occupant feedback is incorporated to allow for users to provide feedback as to their comfort level and allow for changes in the comfort temperature range for their space. A four-month experimental test period shows a 29% HVAC electric energy reduction and a 63% thermal energy reduction compared to previous years for the same time period."

MPC is performed using persistence based climate forecasting with two scenarios examined: fixed temperature setpoint pairs; and a deadband of 1°C between the heating/cooling setpoint. EnergyPlus acts as the “real” building and is linked with R software for model predictive control via the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed. A statistical based building response model is created in R using training data from a calibrated EnergyPlus model. A brute force optimization strategy is used for solving the objective function. A piece-wise objective function maintains thermal comfort during occupied periods with a focus on reducing energy consumption during other periods. Results when using fixed setpoint pairs exhibit a 4% reduction in HVAC energy consumption, and deadband setpoints exhibit a 9% reduction in HVAC energy consumption, compared with reactive rule based control. Of interest is that the type of energy savings (thermal energy vs electricity) varies depending upon the setpoint options. The results are promising given the strict thermal comfort requirement employed, minimal search space, use of simplistic persistence forecasting, and the sophisticated HVAC system."

Extensions are proposed for the distributed controllers aiming to overcome difficulties that arise from the direct application of a standard DMPC formulation. The alternative formulation retains desirable features like the ability to perform energy saving, when demand does not exceed supply, and to effectively distribute energy without disproportionally harming any of the building users, when the system experiences a shortage of energy supply.

@article{Harb2016,
abstract = {Building thermal wall mass provides a flexible heat capacity which can be effectively used for load shifting, thus enabling demand side management (DSM). The most crucial barrier for a practical application of buildings as short term heat storage is the lack of knowledge about the building physical properties. This study presents a model identification approach for forecasting the building thermal response based on grey-box models. The model parameters are estimated by optimizing the model output to historical data under the consideration of plausible physical constraints. The thermal flexibility of a building and therewith its demand side management potential can be determined based on the assessed model parameters. This study uses measurements from buildings in normal operation to evaluate the thermal prediction of grey-box models despite the stochastic events within the training data. In order to find the best level of model complexity, four grey-box models were compared in their ability to forecast the building indoor temperature behaviour. The analysis revealed that a two-capacity model structure with an additional consideration of the indoor air as a mass-less node (4R2C-model) enables the most accurate qualitative prediction of the indoor temperature. Further, the general validity of the model structure allows for its application on different buildings types.},

abstract = {Model predictive control (MPC) is a good candidate to exploit the energy cost savings potential of concrete core activation (CCA), while guaranteeing thermal comfort. A bottleneck for practical implementation is the selection and identification of the building control model. Using grey box models, this article studies the impact of model structure and identification data set on the MPC control performance for an office building with CCA. Results for a one-year simulation show: (1) a second-order model can achieve equal control performance as a fourth-order one, (2) inclusion of solar or internal gains in the identification data set improves the model accuracy in general, especially for the fourth-order models and (3) MPC with a second-order model reduces electricity consumption by 15{\%} compared to a reference controller, hereby deploying information about past operative temperature prediction errors and this without the need for solar or internal gains predictions.},
